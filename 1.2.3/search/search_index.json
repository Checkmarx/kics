You don't have to contribute code. There are plenty of ways you can contribute to KICS project: Reporting new bugs or issues Help triaging issues Improving and translating the documentation Volunteering to maintain the project Code of Conduct By participating and contributing to the project, you agree to uphold our Code of Conduct . Get Started! Follow the instructions below to setup local KICS development environment and push your changes. Fork the kics repo on GitHub. Clone your fork locally: git clone https://github.com/Checkmarx/kics.git Create a branch for local development. Use succinct but descriptive name (prefix with feature/issue#-descriptive-name> or hotfix/issue#-descriptive-name ): git checkout -b <name-of-your-issue> Make your changes locally. Validate your changes to reassure they meet project quality and contribution standards: golint . go mod vendor go test -mod=vendor -v ./... Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub: git add . git commit git push --set-upstream origin <name-of-your-issue> Submit a pull request on GitHub website. How to Contribute Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both: Search for existing issues and pull requests before creating your own to avoid duplicates. PRs will only be accepted if associated with an issue (enhancement or bug) that has been submitted and reviewed/labeled as accepted . We will work hard to make sure issues that are raised are handled in a timely manner. Issues Issues should be used to report problems with the solution / source code, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate. If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a reaction can also help by indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter. Pull Requests Pull Requests (PRs) are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should: Only fix/add the functionality in question or address code style issues, not both. Ensure all necessary details are provided and adhered to. Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists) or specify steps taken to ensure changes were tested and functionality works as expected. Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible. Include documentation in the repo or Provide additional comments in Markdown comments that should be pulled/reflected in GitHub Wiki for the given project. Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created). For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), please open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. Pull Request Guidelines Before you submit a pull request, please reassure that it meets these guidelines: All validations and tests passed locally. The pull request includes tests. The relevant docs are updated, whether you're pushing new functionality or updating a query.

Infrastructure as Code Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the creation, provisioning and configuration of software-defined compute (SDC), network and storage infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. IaC automates the manual tasks usually associated with computing infrastructure configuration and implementation. By doing this, you can: Speed up configuration and implementation of new computing infrastructure Reduce the cost and resource needed to scale and manage large infrastructure Eliminate the inconsistencies that inevitably occur when multiple individuals manually configure new equipment or applications.

IaC security testing tools must be able to consume configuration files and scripts in relevant formats, apply tests to ensure conformance with common configuration hardening standards (i.e., Center for Internet Security Benchmarks and many others), identify security issues associated with specific operational environments, identify embedded secrets, and perform other tests supporting organization-specific standards and compliance requirements. Optionally, tools can automatically remediate errors (e.g., changing read/write permissions on storage resources).

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. Our Standards Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include: Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community Examples of unacceptable behavior include: The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks Public or private harassment Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting Enforcement Responsibilities Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate. Scope This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Enforcement Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at kics@checkmarx.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. Enforcement Guidelines Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct: 1. Correction Community Impact : Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community. Consequence : A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested. 2. Warning Community Impact : A violation through a single incident or series of actions. Consequence : A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban. 3. Temporary Ban Community Impact : A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior. Consequence : A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban. 4. Permanent Ban Community Impact : Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals. Consequence : A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
