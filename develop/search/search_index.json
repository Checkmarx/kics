Within just minutes, you can start making a difference, by sharing your expertise with a community of thousands of security experts and software developers. Contribution Options \u00b6 Good news! You don't have to contribute code. There are plenty of ways you can contribute to KICS project: Reporting new bugs or issues Help triaging issues Improving and translating the documentation Volunteering to maintain the project Code of Conduct \u00b6 By participating and contributing to the project, you agree to uphold our Code of Conduct . Get Started! \u00b6 Follow the instructions below to setup local KICS development environment and push your changes. Fork the kics repo on GitHub. Clone your fork locally: shell git clone https://github.com/Checkmarx/kics.git Create a branch for local development. Use succinct but descriptive name (prefix with feature/issue#-descriptive-name> or hotfix/issue#-descriptive-name ): shell git checkout -b <name-of-your-issue> Make your changes locally. Validate your changes to reassure they meet project quality and contribution standards: shell golint . shell go mod vendor shell go test -mod=vendor -v ./... Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub: shell git add . We recommend following conventional commits messages shell git commit -m \"feat(CLI): add new flag --blabla\" shell git push --set-upstream origin <name-of-your-issue> Submit a pull request on GitHub website. How to Contribute \u00b6 Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both: Search for existing issues and pull requests before creating your own to avoid duplicates. PRs will only be accepted if associated with an issue (enhancement or bug) that has been submitted and reviewed/labeled as accepted . We will work hard to make sure issues that are raised are handled in a timely manner. Issues \u00b6 Issues should be used to report problems with the solution / source code, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate. If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a reaction can also help by indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter. Pull Requests \u00b6 Pull Requests (PRs) are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should: Only fix/add the functionality in question or address code style issues, not both. Ensure all necessary details are provided and adhered to. Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists) or specify steps taken to ensure changes were tested and functionality works as expected. Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible. Include documentation in the repo or Provide additional comments in Markdown comments that should be pulled/reflected in GitHub Wiki for the given project. Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created). For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), please open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. Pull Request Guidelines \u00b6 Before you submit a pull request, please reassure that it meets these guidelines: All validations and tests passed locally. The pull request includes tests. The relevant docs are updated, whether you're pushing new functionality or updating a query. The pull request title should follow conventional commit messages: <type>(<scope>): <subject> where (<scope>) is optional feat - A new feature (example scopes: engine, parser, flags, query) fix - A bug fix docs - Documentation only changes, (example scopes: catalog, guides, platforms, architecture) test - Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests (example scopes: unit, e2e) ci - Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: ghactions, linters) chore - Other changes that don't modify src or test files build - Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scope: makefile) style - Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc) refactor - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature perf - A code change that improves performance revert - Reverts a previous commit e.g: build(makefile): enhance make clean task Templates \u00b6 The following templates will be used when creating a new issue : Enhancement/Feature Request Template New (Approved) Feature Template Query Template Bug Report Template Resources \u00b6 How to Contribute to Open Source Using Pull Requests GitHub Help Join the chat on Gitter .

in two different ways. Command Argument File \u00b6 Create a file with any name/any extension. For the sake of example, let's call it kics-config.json Add the necessary configurations as shown in the templates section in any of the supported formats. Pass the configuration file as argument: kics scan --config kics-config.json Configuration as Code \u00b6 Create a file named kics.config and place it in the root of your project repository. Add the necessary configurations as shown in the templates section in any of the supported formats. Invoke KICS without arguments (KICS will search for the specific file in the root) kics scan Note : If more than one path is given, KICS will warn that --config must be used to explicit decide. Environment variables \u00b6 KICS also accepts environment variables to fill flags values. To use it you just need to have the flag with a KICS_ prefix. For example: To use path flag as environment variable, you should have KICS_PATH on your environment; To use multiple names variables, like --output-path , you should use it with KICS_ and each word separated by _ , e.g.: KICS_OUTPUT_PATH Flags precedence \u00b6 KICS will use the following precende to fill flags: CLI flags Environment variables Configuration file","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"configuration-file/#configuration_file","text":"KICS allow you to provide all configurations either as command line arguments or as code.

This way anyone can start working on a query by picking up a small sample of the vulnerability that the query should target, and convert this sample, which can be a .tf or .yaml file, to our JSON structure JSON. To convert the sample you can run the following command: go run ./cmd/console/main.go scan -p \"pathToTestData\" -d \"pathToGenerateJson\" So for example, if we wanted to transform a .tf file in ./code/test we could type: go run ./cmd/console/main.go scan -p \"./src/test\" -d \"src/test/input.json\" Example of input.json { \"document\": [ { \"resource\": { \"aws_cloudtrail\": { \"positive1\": { \"name\": \"npositive_1\", \"s3_bucket_name\": \"bucketlog_1\" } } }, \"id\": \"02926636-f2c1-46c3-93cc-c7dc2a79791f\", \"file\": \"/assets/queries/terraform/aws/cloudtrail_multi_region_disabled/test/positive1.tf\" }, { \"resource\": { \"aws_cloudtrail\": { \"positive2\": { \"name\": \"npositive_2\", \"s3_bucket_name\": \"bucketlog_2\", \"is_multi_region_trail\": false } } }, \"id\": \"4b27da84-4d38-4422-b2b5-fa85029dad2a\", \"file\": \"assets/queries/terraform/aws/cloudtrail_multi_region_disabled/test/positive2.tf\" } ] } After having the .json that will be our Rego input, we can begin to write queries. To test and debug there are two ways: Using Rego playground Install Open Policy Agent extension in VS Code and create a simple folder with a .rego file for the query and a input.json for the sample to test against Query Development Tutorial \u00b6 In the first instance, take a look at the query composition: - query.rego : Includes the policy and defines the result. The policy builds the pattern that breaks the security of the infrastructure code, which the query is looking for. The result defines the specific data used to present the vulnerability in the infrastructure code. - metadata.json : Each query has a metadata.json companion file with all the relevant information about the vulnerability, including the severity, category and its description; - test : Folder that contains at least one negative and positive case and a JSON file with data about the expected results. - <technology> |- <provider> | |- <queryfolder> | | |- test | | | |- positive1<.ext> | | | |- positive2<.ext> | | | |- negative1<.ext> | | | |- negative2<.ext> | | | |- positive_expected_result.json | | |- metadata.json | | |- query.rego Now, focus on the content of each file: \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb REGO File As a first step, it is important to be familiar with the libraries available (check them in assets/libraries ) and the JSON structure (Rego input). Also, we need to study all the possible cases related to the vulnerability we want to verify before starting the implementation. For example, if we want to verify if the AWS CloudTrail has MultiRegion disabled in a Terraform sample, we need to focus on the attribute is_multi_region_trail of the resource aws_cloudtrail . Since this attribute is optional and false by default, we have two cases: (1) is_multi_region_trail is undefined and (2) is_multi_region_trail is set to false. Observe the following implementation as an example and check the Guidelines below. :rotating_light: Make sure you use package Cx . If you give another name, the query will not load. :rotating_light: package Cx CxPolicy[result] { cloudtrail := input.document[i].resource.aws_cloudtrail[name] object.get(cloudtrail, \"is_multi_region_trail\", \"undefined\") == \"undefined\" result := { \"documentId\": input.document[i].id, \"searchKey\": sprintf(\"aws_cloudtrail[%s]\", [name]), \"issueType\": \"MissingAttribute\", \"keyExpectedValue\": \"CloudTrail Multi Region is defined\", \"keyActualValue\": \"CloudTrail Multi Region is undefined\", } } CxPolicy[result] { cloudtrail := input.document[i].resource.aws_cloudtrail[name] cloudtrail.is_multi_region_trail == false result := { \"documentId\": input.document[i].id, \"searchKey\": sprintf(\"aws_cloudtrail[%s].is_multi_region_trail\", [name]), \"issueType\": \"IncorrectValue\", \"keyExpectedValue\": \"CloudTrail Multi Region is set to true\", \"keyActualValue\": \"CloudTrail Multi Region is set to false\", } } To test the query in the Rego playground , perform the following steps: 1. Enable Coverage (highlights which statements were evaluated); 2. In the input, paste the payload (explained above); 3. In the playground, paste and/or write the policies. Check if the statements are painted green; 4. Click on Evaluate; 5. In the output, check if the results are as expected. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Metadata File Observe the following metadata.json example and check the Guidelines below for more detailed information. { \"id\": \"8173d5eb-96b5-4aa6-a71b-ecfa153c123d\", \"queryName\": \"CloudTrail Multi Region Disabled\", \"severity\": \"MEDIUM\", \"category\": \"Observability\", \"descriptionText\": \"Check if MultiRegion is Enabled\", \"descriptionUrl\": \"https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/cloudtrail#is_multi_region_trail\", \"platform\": \"Terraform\" } \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Data File This file contains a map, with string keys, which will have default values for keys that can be overwritten as described on allowing users to overwrite query data section and using custom input data section of Running KICS \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Test Folder Keep in mind that all the positive and negative files should contain only one breaking point case. This way, the results are more clear. As a best practice, the test folder should contain all the extensions available by the platform. Each positive case should present a breaking point of the vulnerability. Continuing with the example, we should display two positive files: one without the is_multi_region_trail defined (positive1.tf) and another with the is_multi_region_trail set to false (positive2.tf). positive1.tf resource \"aws_cloudtrail\" \"positive1\" { name = \"npositive_1\" s3_bucket_name = \"bucketlog_1\" } positive2.tf resource \"aws_cloudtrail\" \"positive2\" { name = \"npositive_2\" s3_bucket_name = \"bucketlog_2\" is_multi_region_trail = false } Each negative case should present the remediation/best practice (a sample with the is_multi_region_trail set to true). negative1.tf resource \"aws_cloudtrail\" \"negative1\" { name = \"negative\" s3_bucket_name = \"bucketlog\" is_multi_region_trail = true } The positive expected result should present where the positive(s) file(s) break(s) the vulnerability (in line 2 (positive1.tf) and line 4 (positive2.tf)). [ { \"queryName\": \"CloudTrail Multi Region Disabled\", \"severity\": \"MEDIUM\", \"line\": 2, \"fileName\": \"positive1.tf\" }, { \"queryName\": \"CloudTrail Multi Region Disabled\", \"severity\": \"MEDIUM\", \"line\": 4, \"fileName\": \"positive2.tf\" } ] Testing \u00b6 For a query to be considered complete, it must be compliant with at least one positive and one negative test case. To run the unit tests you can run this command: make test Check if the new test was added correctly and if all tests are passing locally. If succeeds, a Pull Request can now be created. Guidelines \u00b6 Filling metadata.json: id should be filled with a UUID. You can use the built-in command to generate this: go run ./cmd/console/main.go generate-id queryName describes the name of the vulnerability severity can be filled with HIGH , MEDIUM , LOW or INFO category pick one of the following: Access Control Availability Backup Best Practices Build Process Encryption Insecure Configurations Insecure Defaults Networking and Firewall Observability Resource Management Secret Management Supply-Chain descriptionText should explain with detail the vulnerability and if possible provide a way to remediate descriptionUrl points to the official documentation about the resource being targeted platform query target platform (e.g. Terraform, Kubernetes, etc.) aggregation [optional] should be used when more than one query is implemented in the same query.rego file. Indicates how many queries are implemented override [optional] should only be used when a metadata.json is shared between queries from different platforms or different specification versions like for example OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger) and OpenAPI 3.0. This field defines an object that each field is mapped to a given overrideKey that should be provided from the query execution result (covered in the next section), if an overrideKey is provided, this will generate a new query that inherits the root level metadata values and only rewrites the fields defined inside this object. If the query.rego file implements more than one query, the metadata.json should indicate how many are implemented (through aggregation ). That can be necessary due to two cases: 1. It implements more than one query in the same query.rego for the same platform { \"id\": \"0ac9abbc-6d7a-41cf-af23-2e57ddb3dbfc\", \"queryName\": \"Sensitive Port Is Exposed To Entire Network\", \"severity\": \"HIGH\", \"category\": \"Networking and Firewall\", \"descriptionText\": \"A sensitive port, such as port 23 or port 110, is open for the whole network in either TCP or UDP protocol\", \"descriptionUrl\": \"https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/azure/azcollection/azure_rm_securitygroup_module.html#parameter-rules\", \"platform\": \"Ansible\", \"aggregation\": 35 } It implements the same query for different platforms in the same query.rego , the metadata bellow defines the query metadata for both OpenAPI 2.0 and 3.0 in the same file: { \"id\": \"332cf2ad-380d-4b90-b436-46f8e635cf38\", \"queryName\": \"Invalid Contact URL (v3)\", \"severity\": \"INFO\", \"category\": \"Best Practices\", \"descriptionText\": \"Contact Object URL should be a valid URL\", \"descriptionUrl\": \"https://swagger.io/specification/#contact-object\", \"platform\": \"OpenAPI\", \"override\": { \"2.0\": { \"id\": \"c7000383-16d0-4509-8cd3-585e5ea2e2f2\", \"queryName\": \"Invalid Contact URL (v2)\", \"descriptionUrl\": \"https://swagger.io/specification/v2/#contactObject\" } }, \"aggregation\": 2 } Filling query.rego: documentId id of the sample where the vulnerability occurs searchKey should indicate where the breaking point occurs in the sample issueType pick one of the following: IncorrectValue MissingAttribute RedundantAttribute keyExpectedValue should explain the expected value keyActualValue should explain the actual value detected overrideKey [optional] should be used when the query can be applied to more than one platform (for now, it is used for both OpenAPI 3.0 and Swagger) For example, the query Invalid Contact URL can be implemented in both OpenAPI 3.0 and Swagger since both versions share the same properties: package Cx import data.generic.openapi as openapi_lib CxPolicy[result] { doc := input.document[i] version := openapi_lib.check_openapi(doc) version != \"undefined\" not openapi_lib.is_valid_url(doc.info.contact.url) result := { \"documentId\": doc.id, \"searchKey\": \"info.contact.url\", \"issueType\": \"IncorrectValue\", \"keyExpectedValue\": \"info.contact.url has a valid URL\", \"keyActualValue\": \"info.contact.url has an invalid URL\", \"overrideKey\": version, } } searchValue [optional] should be used when the query returns more than one result for the same line For example, the query Sensitive Port Is Exposed To Entire Network can return more than one result in the same line (the ingress covers a range of ports). To avoid it, the searchValue should be used. package Cx import data.generic.terraform as terraLib import data.generic.common as commonLib CxPolicy[result] { resource := input.document[i].resource.aws_security_group[name] portContent := commonLib.tcpPortsMap[port] portNumber = port portName = portContent protocol := terraLib.getProtocolList(resource.ingress.protocol)[_] endswith(resource.ingress.cidr_blocks[_], \"/0\") terraLib.containsPort(resource.ingress, portNumber) isTCPorUDP(protocol) result := { \"documentId\": input.document[i].id, \"searchKey\": sprintf(\"aws_security_group[%s].ingress\", [name]), \"searchValue\": sprintf(\"%s,%d\", [protocol, portNumber]), \"issueType\": \"IncorrectValue\", \"keyExpectedValue\": sprintf(\"%s (%s:%d) should not be allowed\", [portName, protocol, portNumber]), \"keyActualValue\": sprintf(\"%s (%s:%d) is allowed\", [portName, protocol, portNumber]), } } isTCPorUDP(\"TCP\") = true isTCPorUDP(\"UDP\") = true Allowing users to overwrite query data \u00b6 Starting on v1.3.5, KICS started to support custom data overwriting on queries. This can be useful if users want to provide their own dataset or if users have different datasets for multiple environments. This can be supported easily following some steps: Create a data.json file on the same level as query.rego ; Define ALL keys that can be overwritten with their default value; On query.rego file, use data.<key_on_data_json_file> to access the value of this key; With these simple steps, users will be able to overwrite the keys they want, elsewhere will use the default value.","title":"Creating Queries"},{"location":"creating-queries/#create_a_new_query","text":"The queries are written in Rego and our internal parser transforms every IaC file that supports into a universal JSON format. This way anyone can start working on a query by picking up a small sample of the vulnerability that the query should target, and convert this sample, which can be a .tf or .yaml file, to our JSON structure JSON. To convert the sample you can run the following command: go run ./cmd/console/main.go scan -p \"pathToTestData\" -d \"pathToGenerateJson\" So for example, if we wanted to transform a .tf file in ./code/test we could type: go run ./cmd/console/main.go scan -p \"./src/test\" -d \"src/test/input.json\" Example of input.json { \"document\": [ { \"resource\": { \"aws_cloudtrail\": { \"positive1\": { \"name\": \"npositive_1\", \"s3_bucket_name\": \"bucketlog_1\" } } }, \"id\": \"02926636-f2c1-46c3-93cc-c7dc2a79791f\", \"file\": \"/assets/queries/terraform/aws/cloudtrail_multi_region_disabled/test/positive1.tf\" }, { \"resource\": { \"aws_cloudtrail\": { \"positive2\": { \"name\": \"npositive_2\", \"s3_bucket_name\": \"bucketlog_2\", \"is_multi_region_trail\": false } } }, \"id\": \"4b27da84-4d38-4422-b2b5-fa85029dad2a\", \"file\": \"assets/queries/terraform/aws/cloudtrail_multi_region_disabled/test/positive2.tf\" } ] } After having the .json that will be our Rego input, we can begin to write queries.

One-liner Install Script \u00b6 Run the following command to download and install kics. It will detect your current OS and download the appropriate binary package, defaults installation to ./bin and the queries will be placed alongside the binary in ./bin/assets/queries : curl -sfL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Checkmarx/kics/master/install.sh' | bash If you want to place it somewhere else like /usr/local/bin : sudo curl -sfL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Checkmarx/kics/master/install.sh' | bash -s -- -b /usr/local/bin Binary \u00b6 KICS release process is pretty straightforward. When we're releasing a new version, we'll pack KICS executables for Linux, Windows and macOS operating systems. Our security queries will be included in the ZIP files and tarballs, so that you can scan your IaC code with the out-of-the-box queries. So all you need is: Go to KICS releases Download KICS binaries based on your OS Extract files Run kics executable with the cli options as described below (note that kics binary should be located in the same directory as queries directory) shell ./kics scan -p '<path-of-your-project-to-scan>' -o '<output-results.json>' Build from Sources \u00b6 Download and install Go from https://golang.org/dl/ Clone the repository: shell git clone https://github.com/Checkmarx/kics.git Build the binaries: shell cd kics make build Kick a scan! shell ./bin/kics scan -p '<path-of-your-project-to-scan>' --report-formats json -o ./results Note : KICS does not execute scan by default anymore.

Fail by severity usage example \u00b6 If you want your pipeline just to fail on HIGH, MEDIUM severity results and KICS engine execution errors: steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v2 - name: Mkdir results-dir # make sure results dir is created run: mkdir -p results-dir - name: run kics Scan uses: checkmarx/kics-action@latest with: path: 'terraform,my-other-sub-folder/Dockerfile' fail_on: high,medium output_path: results-dir - name: display kics results run: | cat results-dir/results.json Don't fail on results \u00b6 If you want KICS to ignore the results and return exit status code 0 unless a KICS engine error happens: steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v2 - name: Mkdir results-dir # make sure results dir is created run: mkdir -p results-dir - name: run kics Scan uses: checkmarx/kics-action@latest with: path: 'terraform' ignore_on_exit: results output_path: results-dir - name: display kics results run: | cat results-dir/results.json Profiling KICS \u00b6 You can only enable one profiler at a time, CPU or MEM. \ud83d\udcdd Please note that execution time may be impacted by enabling performance profiler due to sampling steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v2 - name: Mkdir results-dir # make sure results dir is created run: mkdir -p results-dir - name: run kics Scan uses: checkmarx/kics-action@latest with: path: 'terraform' profiling: MEM output_path: results-dir - name: display kics results run: | cat results-dir/results.json Uploading SARIF report \u00b6 name: scan with KICS and upload SARIF on: pull_request: branches: [master] jobs: kics-job: runs-on: ubuntu-latest name: kics-action steps: - name: Checkout repo uses: actions/checkout@v2 - name: Mkdir results-dir # make sure results dir is created run: mkdir -p results-dir - name: Run KICS Scan with SARIF result uses: checkmarx/kics-action@latest with: path: 'terraform' # when provided with a directory on output_path # it will generate the specified reports file named 'results.{extension}' # in this example it will generate: # - results-dir/results.json # - results-dir/results.sarif output_path: results-dir platform_type: terraform output_formats: 'json,sarif' exclude_paths: \"terraform/gcp/big_data.tf,terraform/azure\" # seek query id in it's metadata.json exclude_queries: 0437633b-daa6-4bbc-8526-c0d2443b946e - name: Show results run: | cat results-dir/results.sarif cat results-dir/results.json - name: Upload SARIF file uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v1 with: sarif_file: results-dir/results.sarif Using configuration file \u00b6 Check configuration file reference for more options. name: scan with KICS using config file on: pull_request: branches: [master] jobs: kics-job: runs-on: ubuntu-latest name: kics-action steps: - name: Checkout repo uses: actions/checkout@v2 - name: Mkdir results-dir # make sure results dir is created run: mkdir -p results-dir - name: Create config file # creating a heredoc config file run: | cat <<EOF >>kics.config { \"exclude-categories\": \"Encryption\", \"exclude-paths\": \"terraform/gcp/big_data.tf,terraform/gcp/gcs.tf\", \"log-file\": true, \"minimal-ui\": false, \"no-color\": false, \"no-progress\": true, \"output-path\": \"./results-dir\", \"payload-path\": \"file path to store source internal representation in JSON format\", \"preview-lines\": 5, \"report-formats\": \"json,sarif\", \"type\": \"terraform\", \"verbose\": true } EOF - name: Run KICS Scan using config uses: checkmarx/kics-action@latest with: path: 'terraform' config_path: ./kics.config - name: Upload SARIF file uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v1 with: sarif_file: results-dir/results.sarif Resources \u00b6 KICS GitHub Action in Github Marketplace .

It builds up a policy and defines the result. The policy builds the pattern that breaks the security of the infrastructure code and which the query is looking for. The result defines the specific data used to present the vulnerability in the infrastructure code. Metadata \u00b6 Each query has a metadata.json companion file with all the relevant information about the vulnerability , including the severity, category and its description. For example, the JSON code above is the metadata corresponding to the query in the beginning of this document. { \"id\": \"5738faf3-3fe6-4614-a93d-f0003242d4f9\", \"queryName\": \"All Users Group Gets Read Access\", \"severity\": \"HIGH\", \"category\": \"Identity and Access Management\", \"descriptionText\": \"It's not recommended to allow read access for all user groups.\", \"descriptionUrl\": \"https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket#acl\", \"platform\": \"Terraform\" } Organization \u00b6 Filesystem-wise, KICS queries are organized per IaC technology or tool (e.g., terraform, k8s, dockerfile, etc.) and grouped under provider (e.g., aws, gcp, azure, etc.) when applicable. Per each query created, it is mandatory the creation of test cases with, at least, one negative and positive case and a JSON file with data about the expected results, as shown below: [ { \"queryName\": \"All Users Group Gets Read Access\", \"severity\": \"HIGH\", \"line\": 3 } ] Summarizing, the following is the expected file tree for a query: - <technology> |- <provider> | |- <queryfolder> | | |- test | | | |- positive<.ext> | | | |- negative<.ext> | | | |- positive_expected_result.json | | |- metadata.json | | |- query.rego Also, a query can contains multiples positive and negative files, but all cases files names must start with negative or positive and each positive file must be referencered on positive_expected_result.json , as shown below: [ { \"queryName\": \"ELB Sensitive Port Is Exposed To Entire Network\", \"severity\": \"HIGH\", \"line\": 37, \"fileName\": \"positive1.yaml\" }, { \"queryName\": \"ELB Sensitive Port Is Exposed To Entire Network\", \"severity\": \"HIGH\", \"line\": 22, \"fileName\": \"positive2.yaml\" } ] And the file tree should be as follows: - <technology> |- <provider> | |- <queryfolder> | | |- test | | | |- positive1<.ext> | | | |- positive2<.ext> | | | |- negative1<.ext> | | | |- negative2<.ext> | | | |- positive_expected_result.json | | |- metadata.json | | |- query.rego","title":"General Info"},{"location":"queries/#queries","text":"KICS queries are written in OPA (Rego).

To see if a query supports overwriting, check if the query's folder contains a data.json file, this file will contain all keys that can be overwritten. To overwrite the key, you need to create files following the pattern <query_id>.json , each file representing one query and passing folder path containing these files to the flag input-data , this will get all files from this folder and replace all keys on queries found. NOTE : Keys that are not overwritten will use the default value proposed by data.json file of targeted query. For example, on queries/common/passwords_and_secrets_in_infrastructure_code/ contains the following data.json : { \"defaultPasswords\": [ \"!@\", \"root\", \"wubao\", ... ], \"blackList\": [ \"RESOURCE\", \"GROUP\", \"SUBNET\", ... ] } This means there are two keys, defaultPasswords and blackList , that can be overwritten. On the query, you can search them on query.rego file with: data.defaultPasswords and data.blackList , to understand how it is used by the query. To overwrite defaultPasswords , you can create a file f996f3cb-00fc-480c-8973-8ab04d44a8cc.json on a folder custom-input , for example, as following: { \"defaultPasswords\": [ \"myCustomValue1\", \"myCustomValue2\", \"myCustomValue3\", ] } Then you can execute KICS normally adding --input-data ./custom-input/ , if custom-input folder is in current path, and it will replace the key defaultPasswords on passwords_and_secrets_in_infrastructure_code query with the custom value you defined. NOTE : The value which will replace the default value, MUST be the same type as the default key (e.g. defaultPasswords must be an array of strings) Using commands on scanned files as comments \u00b6 KICS scan supports some special commands in the comments that are on the file beginning (i.e.: all comments before any valid line on IaC file). To use this feature you need to create a comment that starts with kics-scan and wanted command with values (if necessary). For example, if you want to ignore a tf file when running a scan, you can start your file as following: # kics-scan ignore # rest of the file... If you need to start with a header comment, you can add another line below with the kics-scan command you want, but kics-scan will not works if there is any valid line above it, as you can see on the following example: # Some comment # This works # kics-scan ignore resource \"google_storage_bucket\" \"example\" { # This does not works # kics-scan ignore name = \"image-store.com\" location = \"EU\" force_destroy = true } # This also not works, since there is valid script before this comment # kics-scan ignore KICS currently supports three commands: - ignore : Will ignore file when running a scan; - enable=<query_id>,<query_id> : Will get results on this file only for listed queries; - disable=<query_id>,<query_id> : Will ignore results on this file for listed queries; The order of prescendence in above commands are: 1. ignore 2. enable 3. disable For example: # kics-scan disable=0afa6ab8-a047-48cf-be07-93a2f8c34cf7 # kics-scan In this case, this file will be ignored by KICS, instead of ignoring results for query with id 0afa6ab8-a047-48cf-be07-93a2f8c34cf7.
