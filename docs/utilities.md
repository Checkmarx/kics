## LINES SCANNED AND LINES PARSED 

KICS presents the number of lines scanned and the number of lines parsed. Both are presented in LOG messages and the JSON report. Note that the number of the lines includes empty ones.

Lines scanned are the lines of the files that were scanned, in the first instance, before the "parser step". The lines parsed are the lines of the files that KICS parsed.
