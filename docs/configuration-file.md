## Configuration File

KICS allow you to provide all configurations either as command line arguments or as code.

Here is a Configuration file example:

```JSON
{
  "path": "assets/iac_samples",
  "verbose": true,
  "log-file": true,
  "type": "Dockerfile,Kubernetes",
  "queries-path": "assets/queries",
  "output-path": "results.json"
}
```

The same example now in YAML format passing `type` as an array of strings:

```YAML
path: assets/iac_samples
verbose: true
log-file: true
type:
  - Dockerfile
  - Kubernetes
queries-path: "assets/queries"
output-path: "results.json"
```

> üìù flags that can receive multiple values can be either provided as a comma separated string or an array as in the example above

---

## Supported Formats
KICS supports the following formats for the configuration files.

- JSON
- TOML
- YAML
- HCL

Notice that format is about the content and not the file extension.

KICS is able to infer the format without the need of file extension.

## How to Use
You can enclose all your configurations in a file and use it in two different ways.

#### Command Argument File

1. Create a file with any name/any extension. For the sake of example, let's call it `kics-config.json`
2. Add the necessary configurations as shown in the templates section in any of the supported formats.
3. Pass the configuration file as argument:
```
kics scan --config kics-config.json
```

#### Configuration as Code

1. Create a file named `kics.config` and place it in the root of your project repository.
2. Add the necessary configurations as shown in the templates section in any of the supported formats.
3. Invoke KICS without arguments (KICS will search for the specific file in the root)
```
kics scan
```

**Note**: CLI flags will have priority over the configuration file properties!
