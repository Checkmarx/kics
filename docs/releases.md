## Releases

For our release versions we follow the <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank">SemVer</a> specification, meaning that we structure our versions into a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH semantic.

Our current release process is structured in the following way:

-   PATCH versions for minor backwards compatible bug fixes and new small features. This should have a bi-weekly cadence.
-   MINOR versions will include functionality that is backwards compatible. This should have a monthly cadence.
-   MAJOR versions for major functionality that it's added or changes that are not backwards compatible.

Every release is packed with:

-   Docker image uploaded to <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/checkmarx/kics" target="_blank">DockerHub</a>

If waiting for a new release it's not enough, we also provide nightly builds that include the latest changes.
