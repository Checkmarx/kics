## Releases

For our release versions we follow the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) specification, meaning that we structure our versions into a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH semantic.

Our current release process is structured in the following way:

- PATCH versions for minor backwards compatible bug fixes and new small features. This should have a bi-weekly cadence.
- MINOR versions will include functionality that is backwards compatible. This should have a monthly cadence.
- MAJOR versions for major functionality that it's added or changes that are not backwards compatible.

Every release is packed with:

- Source code .zip/tarballs
- Binaries for Windows and Linux
- Docker image uploaded to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/checkmarx/kics)

If waiting for a new release it's not enough, we also provide nightly builds that include the latest changes.
