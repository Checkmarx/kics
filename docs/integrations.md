## Integrations

For effective and secure continuous delivery of a cloud native project, it's advised to integrate KICS into your project CI pipeline.  

In a nutshell, a typical CI process would looke something like the following:

1. Deploy KICS.
1. Clone your project source code repo.
1. Run KICS on the project source code.
1. Parse the [output results](results.md).
1. Pass or fail the build based on the results.

For specific instructions see the [getting started page](getting-started.md).
