## Integrations

You can integrate KICS into your CI with Github Actions. 
This provides you the ability to integrate KICS scans and apply KICS vulnerabilities and miconfiguration checks to your infrastructure as code (IaC)

Use KICS GitHub action from the [marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/kics-github-action)

and read about GitHub actions integration in the official GitHub [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/quickstart)

Here you can see it in action ;)
