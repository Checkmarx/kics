---

**KICS** is an open source solution for static code analysis of Infrastructure as Code.

**K**eeping **I**nfrastructure as **C**ode **S**ecure (in short **KICS**) is a must-have for any cloud native project. With KICS, finding security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and infrastructure misconfigurations happens early in the development cycle, when fixing these is straightforward and cheap.

It is as simple as running a CLI tool, making it easy to integrate into any project CI.

#### Supported Platforms

KICS scans and detects issues in following Infrastructure as Code solutions:

<img alt="Terraform" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Checkmarx/kics/master/docs/img/logo-terraform.png" width="150">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img alt="Kubernetes" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Checkmarx/kics/master/docs/img/logo-k8s.png" width="150">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img alt="Docker" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Checkmarx/kics/master/docs/img/logo-docker.png" width="150">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img alt="CloudFormation" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Checkmarx/kics/master/docs/img/logo-cf.png" width="150">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img alt="Ansible" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Checkmarx/kics/master/docs/img/logo-ansible.png" width="150">

Support of other solutions, such as Chef, and of additional cloud providers are on the [roadmap](roadmap.md).


## Getting Started

Setting up and using KICS is super-easy.

- First, see how to [install and get KICS running](getting-started.md).
- Then explore KICS [output results format](results.md) and quickly fix the issues detected.

Interested in more advanced stuff?
- Deep dive into KICS [queries](queries.md).
- Understand how you to [integrate](integrations.md) KICS in your favourit CI/CD pipelines.

## How it Works

What makes KICS really powerful and popular is its built-in extensibility. This extensibility is achieved by:

- Fully customizable and adjustable heuristics rules, called [queries](queries.md). These can be easily edited, extended and added.
- Robust but yet simple [architecture](architecture.md), which allows quick addition of support for new Infrastructure as Code solutions.
