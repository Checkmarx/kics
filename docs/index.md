#### Supported Platforms

KICS scans and detects issues in following Infrastructure as Code solutions:

<img alt="Terraform" src="img/logo-terraform.png" width="150">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img alt="Kubernetes" src="img/logo-k8s.png" width="150">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img alt="Docker" src="img/logo-docker.png" width="150">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Support of other solutions, such as Chef, and of additional cloud providers are on the [roadmap](roadmap.md).


## Getting Started

Setting up and using KICS is super-easy.

- First, see how to [install and get KICS running](getting-started.md).
- Then explore KICS [output results format](results.md) and quickly fix the issues detected.

Interested in more advanced stuff?
- Deep dive into KICS [queries](queries.md).
- Understand how you to [integrate](integrations.md) KICS in your favourit CI/CD pipelines.

## How it Works

What makes KICS really powerful and popular is its built-in extensibility. This extensibility is achieved by:

- Fully customizable and adjustable heuristics rules, called [queries](queries.md). These can be easily edited, extended and added.
- Robust but yet simple [architecture](architecture.md), which allows quick addition of support for new Infrastructure as Code solutions.
