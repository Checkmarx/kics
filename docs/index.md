---

KICS (pronounced as 'kick-s') is an open source solution for static code analysis of Infrastructure as Code.

**K**eeping **I**nfrastructure as **C**ode **S**ecure (in short **KICS**) is a must-have for any cloud native project. With KICS, finding security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and infrastructure misconfigurations happens early in the development cycle, when fixing these is straightforward and cheap.

It is as simple as running a CLI tool, making it easy to integrate into any project CI.

#### Supported Platforms

KICS scans and detects issues in following Infrastructure as Code solutions:

<img alt="Docker" src="img/logo-docker.png" width="150">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img alt="Kubernetes" src="img/logo-k8s.png" width="150">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img alt="Ansible" src="img/logo-ansible.png" width="150">

More solutions, such as AWS CloudFormation are on the [roadmap](roadmap.md).


## Getting Started

Setting up and using KICS is super-easy.

- First, see how to [install and get KICS running](getting-started.md).
- Next, check how you can easily [integrate it into your CI](integrations.md) for any project.
- Eventually, [explore the output results format](results.md) and quickly fix the issues detected.

## How it Works

What makes KICS really powerful and popular is its built-in extensibility. This extensibility is achieved by:

- Fully customizable and adjustable heuristics rules, called [queries](queries.md). These can be easily edited, extended, and added.
- Robust but yet simple [architecture](architecture.md), which allows quick addition of support for new Infrastructure as Code solutions.


## Contribution

KICS is a true community project. It's built as an open source from day one, and anyone can find his own way to contribute to the project.  
[Check out how](contribution.md), within just minutes, you can start making a difference, by sharing your expertise with a community of thousands of security experts and software developers.

## About the Project

The [KICS project](about.md) is powered by [Checkmarx](https://www.checkmarx.com/), global leader of Application Security Testing.

KICS will always stay an open source and free project for the benefit of global software industry community.  
We believe that when **Software is Everywhere, Security is Everything**.  

Now, Software <span style="color: #5FBB46">**=**</span> **Security**.
