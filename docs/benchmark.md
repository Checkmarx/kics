## KICS Benchmark

The values below were obtained after scanning 150 open source projects with KICS (v1.2.0) covering 
the supported IaC technologies (c.f., Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes, Docker, AWS Cloudformation).


| IaC Technology    | Query Accuracy<sup>1</sup>    | Query Coverage<sup>2</sup> | Scanned IaC files​ | Number of Results​ | Average Scan Time​ (s) | Average Project Size |
| :---              | :---     | :---    | :--- | :---     | :---| :---|
| Terraform​         | 99.3%​    | 45.53%​  | 1176​ | 854​      | TBD​ | TBD​ |
| Docker​            | 81.8%​    | 68%​     | 1017​ | 4064​     | TBD​ | TBD |​
