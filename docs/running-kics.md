# Running KICS

## Supported Resources

KICS makes use of the <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter#go-getter">go-getter</a> package in order to scan files or directories from various sources.

KICS is able to perform scans on these types of paths:

 - Local Files
 - Archived Files
 - S3
 - Git
 - GSC

 Files and directories that are not local will be placed in a temporarly folder during KICS execution.


### Local Files

```
kics scan -p path/local
```

### Archived Files

Available archive formats:

- `tar.gz` and `tgz`
- `tar.bz2` and `tbz2`
- `tar.xz` and `txz`
- `zip`
- `gz`
- `bz2`
- `xz`

```
kics scan -p path/local.zip
```

### S3

S3 Bucket path syntax:

```
s3::{S3 Bucket URL}?{query parameters}
```

#### Query Parameters:

- `aws_access_key_id` - AWS access key.
- `aws_access_key_secret` - AWS access key secret.
- `aws_access_token` - AWS access token if this is being used.
- `aws_profile` - Use this profile from local ~/.aws/ config. Takes - priority over the other three.


```
kics scan -p s3::https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/foo?aws_profile=~/.aws/profile
```

### Git

```
kics scan -p git::https://github.com/Checkmarx/kics
```

#### SSH

```
kics scan -p git::git@github.com:Checkmarx/kics.git
```

Please make sure you have SSH private key configured with your github account

### GSC

```
kics scan -p gcs::https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/bucket
```

Please make sure you have set GSC authentication credentials to your application code by environment variables

## Using custom input data
Since from v1.3.5, KICS supports using custom input data to replace data on queries that have this feature supported. To see if a query supports overwriting, check if the query's folder contains a `data.json` file, this file will contain all keys that can be overwritten.
To overwrite the key, you need to create files following the pattern `<query_id>.json`, each file representing **one** query and passing folder path containing these files to the flag `input-data`, this will get all files from this folder and replace all keys on queries found.

**NOTE**: Keys that are not overwritten will use the default value proposed by `data.json` file of targeted query.

For example, on `queries/common/passwords_and_secrets_in_infrastructure_code/` contains the following `data.json`:

```json
{
  "defaultPasswords": [
    "!@",
    "root",
    "wubao",
    ...
  ],
  "blackList": [
    "RESOURCE",
    "GROUP",
    "SUBNET",
    ...
  ]
}

```

This means there are two keys, `defaultPasswords` and `blackList`, that can be overwritten. On the query, you can search them on `query.rego` file with: `data.defaultPasswords` and `data.blackList`, to understand how it is used by the query.

To overwrite `defaultPasswords`, you can create a file `f996f3cb-00fc-480c-8973-8ab04d44a8cc.json` on a folder `custom-input`, for example, as following:

```json
{
  "defaultPasswords": [
    "myCustomValue1",
    "myCustomValue2",
    "myCustomValue3",
  ]
}
```

Then you can execute KICS normally adding `--input-data ./custom-input/`, if `custom-input` folder is in current path, and it will replace the key `defaultPasswords` on `passwords_and_secrets_in_infrastructure_code` query with the custom value you defined.

**NOTE**: The value which will replace the default value, **MUST** be the same type as the default key (e.g. `defaultPasswords` must be an array of strings)
