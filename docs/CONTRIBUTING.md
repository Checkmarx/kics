## How to Contribute

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs).  A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing [issues](https://github.com/Checkmarx/kics/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/Checkmarx/kics/pulls) before creating your own to avoid duplicates.
- PRs will only be accepted if associated with an issue (enhancement or bug) that has been submitted and reviewed/labeled as *accepted*.
- We will work hard to make sure issues that are raised are handled in a timely manner.

#### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the solution / source code, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help by indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.


#### Pull Requests

Pull Requests (PRs) are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **or** address code style issues, not both.
- Ensure all necessary details are provided and adhered to.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists) or specify steps taken to ensure changes were tested and functionality works as expected.
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation in the repo or Provide additional comments in Markdown comments that should be pulled/reflected in GitHub Wiki for the given project.
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), please open an Issue to discuss your proposal first.

#### Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, please reassure that it meets these guidelines:

1. All validations and tests passed locally.
2. The pull request includes tests.
3. The relevant docs are updated, whether you're pushing new functionality or updating a query.
4. The pull request title should follow conventional commit messages:

`<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
where `(<scope>)` is optional

```
feat - A new feature (example scopes: engine, parser, flags, query)
fix - A bug fix
docs - Documentation only changes, (example scopes: catalog, guides, platforms, architecture)
test - Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests (example scopes: unit, e2e)
ci - Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: ghactions, linters)
chore - Other changes that don't modify src or test files
build - Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scope: makefile)
style - Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
refactor - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
perf - A code change that improves performance
revert - Reverts a previous commit
```

e.g: `build(makefile): enhance make clean task`

#### Templates

The following templates will be used when [creating a new issue](https://github.com/Checkmarx/kics/issues/new/choose):

- Enhancement/Feature Request Template
- New (Approved) Feature Template
- Query Template
- Bug Report Template

## Tips 

### Github Actions failing on E2E tests

If an E2E test causes failures in Github actions, the recommended steps are: 

1. Open the action that causes fail.
2. Go to Summary tab.
3. On the Summary page, go through the bottom of the page and download any artifact that not has an `.dockerbuild` extension.
4. Extract the e2e-report and open the HTML in a browser.
5. Filter the tests to display only those that failed.
6. Check which test is causing the issue (e.g., E2E-CLI-032) and review the error description (e.g. number of lines not matching the expected value).
7. Navigate to the `e2e/testcases` directory on [KICS github repository](https://github.com/Checkmarx/kics/tree/master/e2e/testcases) and open the Go file corresponding to the failing test (e.g. `e2e-cli-032_scan_output-path_validate_json.go`).

8. Manually run a scan using the arguments provided in the file. 
   Example for `E2E-CLI-032`:   
   ```sh
   go run .\cmd\console\main.go scan -o "/path/e2e/output" --output-name "E2E_CLI_032_RESULT" -p "/path/e2e/fixtures/samples/positive.yaml"
   ``` 
   Here, `/path/e2e/output` is where the scan results will be stored, and `/path/e2e/fixtures/samples/positive.yaml` is the input file that should be used by replacing path with the path to `positive.yaml` on your local machine.

9. Navigate to the path specified by the `-o` flag and compare the generated file with the version in the [fixtures directory of the KICS repository](https://github.com/Checkmarx/kics/tree/master/e2e/fixtures).

10. Merge the generated file or add any missing data to the original file in the repository. **Example**: paste the generated `E2E_CLI_032_RESULT` into `e2e/fixtures/e2e/E2E_CLI_032_RESULT.json`.

11. Correct the path, to `/path/e2e/fixtures/samples/positive.yaml`, if it currently points to a local machine directory. **Example**: change `C:\Users\john\Desktop\kics\e2e\fixtures\samples\positive.yaml` to `/path/e2e/fixtures/samples/positive.yaml`.

12. Commit and push the changes.

### GitGuard Security Checks failing on the pipeline

If the pipeline fails when submitting a Pull Request, it may be due to GitGuard detecting a secret. In such cases, the KICS team will review the detected secret. If the secret is confirmed to be used only for testing purposes, the action will be marked as a False Positive and can be safely ignored.

### Flacky tests

There is a known set of tests that are considered flaky. These tests may fail intermittently due to timming issues, external dependencies or environment-specific conditions, rather than actual problems on the code. The team is aware of these cases and continues to monitor and improve them. 

Below is a list of currently identified flaky tests:

- CycloneDX
- analyserPaths

Tests that compare terminal output are particularly prone to flakiness. Typically, a test is considered flaky if it passes on two operating systems but fails on one
Tests that compare terminal output are particularly prone to flakiness. Typically, an flacky test is detected when, for the unit tests, it passes for two different operating systems but, for one in specific is does not. Normally, for this cases is a flacky test and, the KICS team should re-run the actions. 

### Unit tests

When a unit test fails in the KICS pipeline, there are two recommended approaches:

1. Open the failing unit-test page, go to **Test and Generate Report Dev**, wait for the report to generate, then search for `FAIL:` to identify the issue.

2. Alternatively, access the **Summary** tab, download the artifact that includes the failing OS in its name (or any artifact if all OS tests fail), open it, and search for `FAIL:` or the name of the query (e.g., `user_data_contains_encodd_private_key`).

Unit test failures can occurr due to incorrectly defined lines in `positive_expected_result.json` or missing tests in that file.

### Grype or Trivy tests failing

Sometimes the KICS pipelines may fail due to issues in the Grype and Trivy tests. In such cases, it might be sufficient to just update the version on the `go.mod` file. For such cases here are the recommended steps:

1. Open the action that is currently failing.
2. Go to the `Summary` tab on the top left corner.
3. Go to the `Grype docker image scan` or `Trivy docker image scan` jobs.
4. Download the artifact `trivy-fs-scan-results` or similar.
5. Open the `results.txt` file and check if there is any table that suggests the the new version of the library that is causing the problem.
6. After that, go to the `go.mod` file that is on the root of the repository and, change the version of the library to the version that is suggested on the file `results.txt` downloaded.
7. Run `go mod tidy`.
8. Run `go mod vendor`.
9. Commit and push the changes.

NOTE: This is only a solution to solve the cases when the results provide a library that is on `go.mod` file and has a recommended fixed version. In some cases, there is no recommended version for the library on the `results.txt` or the library mentioned on the file is not on the `go.mod` file, for these cases, commonly it is needed to update the image on the `Dockerfile`.
