## What is Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning software through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. 

IaC automates the manual tasks usually associated with computing infrastructure configuration and implementation.
By doing this, you can:

- Speed up configuration and implementation of new computing infrastructure
- Reduce the cost and resource needed to scale and manage large infrastructure
- Eliminate the inconsistencies that inevitably occur when multiple individuals manually configure new equipment or applications.

The core concepts of IaC are:

- Defined in code
- Stored in a repository
- Declarative or Imperative
- Idempotence and Consistency
- Push or Pull

Main Benefits of IaC:

- Fully automated deployment
- Consistent environments
- Repeatable process
- Reusable components ("DRY")
- Documented Architecture
