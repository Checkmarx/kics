The other commands have no further options.

## Library Flag Usage

As mentioned above, the library flag (`-b`) refers to the directory with libraries. The functions need to be grouped by platform and the library file name should follow the format: `<platform>.rego` to be loaded by KICS. It doesn't matter your directory structure. In other words, for example, if you want to indicate a directory that contains a library for your terraform queries, you should group your functions (used in your terraform queries) in a file named `terraform.rego` wherever you want.


---

## Profiling

With the `--profiling` flag KICS will print resource consumption information in the logs.

You can only enable one profiler at a time, CPU or MEM.

üìù   Please note that execution time may be impacted by enabling performance profiler due to sampling

## Disable Crash Report

You can disable KICS crash report to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) with `DISABLE_CRASH_REPORT` environment variable set to `0` or `false` e.g:

```sh
DISABLE_CRASH_REPORT=0 ./bin/kics version
# 'KICS crash report disabled' message should appear in the logs
```
