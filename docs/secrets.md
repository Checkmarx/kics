## Password and Secrets
Being the only query written in Golang, it involves several rules to cover the maximum possible cases. These rules bases on regexes. 
Each one is mainly composed of id, name and regex.

Since there are cases where it is necessary to filter the results of these rules (i.e. cases to exclude), you can use **allowRules**. 
Basically, there are two types: **specific allowRules**, which is just applied to a specific rule and **generic allowRules**, which is applied to all rules.

```json
{
  "rules": [
      {
        "id": "rule identifier",
        "name": "intuitive rule name",
        "regex": "golang flavor regex",
        "allowRules": [
          {
            "description": "brief description about the cases to exclude",
            "regex": "golang flavor regex"
          }
        ]
      }
  ],
    "allowRules": [
          {
            "description": "brief description about the cases to exclude",
            "regex": "golang flavor regex"
          }
    ]  
}
```

#### Example

The present rule defines a pattern that finds generic tokens. 
Since, in Terraform, we can come across cases like `token_key = data.terraform_remote_state.rancher.outputs.token_key`, we can use a **specific allowRules** (Avoiding TF resource access) to exclude these cases.

Moreover, to exclude scenarios like `automountServiceAccountToken: false`, we can use a **generic allowRules** (Avoiding Boolean's) to be applied not only in this rule but also in the remaining ones.

```json
{
  "rules": [
     {
          "id": "baee238e-1921-4801-9c3f-79ae1d7b2cbc",
          "name": "Generic Token",
          "regex": "(?i)['\"]?token(_)?(key)?['\"]?\\s*[:=]\\s*['\"]?([[A-Za-z0-9/~^_!@&%()=?*+-]+)['\"]?",
          "allowRules": [
            {
              "description": "Avoiding TF resource access",
              "regex": "(?i)['\"]?password['\"]?\\s*=\\s*([a-zA-z_]+(.))?[a-zA-z_]+(.)[a-zA-z_]+(.)[a-zA-z_]+"
            }
          ]
     }
  ],
  "allowRules": [
          {
            "description": "Avoiding Boolean's",
            "regex": "(?i)['\"]?[a-zA-Z_]+['\"]?\\s*[=:]\\s*['\"]?(true|false)['\"]?"
          }
   ] 
}
```


#### Flags
It is important to mention that you can disable this query through flag `--disable-secrets`.
Furthermore, if you want to add new rules, you can point the path through the flag `--secrets-regexes-path`.
