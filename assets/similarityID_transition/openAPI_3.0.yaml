      queryName: Object Without Required Property (v3)
      observations: Possibly fixed â€“ I was unable to reproduce the duplication issue, but I added searchLine in hopes that it resolves it. [The closest I got was with servers defined both inside an operation (e.g., get) and at the root level] Also, I modified searchKey because it was printing sets of array indexes. The query should still be further refined
