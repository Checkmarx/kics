# KICS
The present repository contains the source code of the Datadog version of KICS. OSV-Scanner is a project originally owned by Checkmarx to find security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and infrastructure misconfigurations early in the development cycle of your infrastructure-as-code.

At Datadog, we use it to scan your Terraform code and output a SARIF file and report it to our backend.

For more details about the full capabilities of the tool, please refer to the upstream repository.
