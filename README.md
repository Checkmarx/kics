Checkmarx Infrastructure as Code Scanning Engine (ICE)

**ICE** is a infrastructure-as-code Engine that scans infrastructure provisioned using [Terraform](https://terraform.io/).

ICE identifies security vulnerabilties and misconfigurations that may expose IaC files owners to cyber attacks.

ICE also powers [**Checkmarx**](https://www.checkmarx.com/products/static-application-security-testing  ) SAST product, the security-first platform that streamlines code security throughout DevSecOps lifecycle.
